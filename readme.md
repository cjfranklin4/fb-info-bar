# About


Facebook has become part of daily life for millions of people around the world. We've become comfortable with the platform that provides a space where we can connect with friends and family, build communities, and more. However, many users do not know the extent of Facebook's grasp on their information, whether it was shared willingly online or unwillingly offline.

You have a right to know what your Facebook experience is being used for. While Facebook says it has a commitment to protecting its users' privacy, the many scandals that appear each year say differently.

Your private data is important, both to you and tech companies like Facebook. It can range from your Facebook posts, photos, or pages you like to your location data and purchase history from various businesses. Do you feel comfortable with this much information about you in the hands of Facebook?

Take the first step in regaining your power from Facebook, the power of controlling the access to your private data.
