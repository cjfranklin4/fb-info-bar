    <h1>Off Activity Tracking</h1>
    <p>The Facebook Off Activity Tracking (OAT) page is a summary of Facebook’s tracking of your non-Facebook activity, from both mobile and desktop. You may not have heard or seen this page as it is hidden behind various menus. According to Facebook, OAT tracks information as such:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apps opened on your phone (with or without Facebook log in)</li>
      <li>Content viewed on those apps </li>
      <li>Item search results, your shopping cart and purchase history, and donations. </li>
      <li>Businesses partnered with Facebook will send this information to the company. (and companies are not required to explain in detail what parts of our data they are sending to Facebook)</li>

      <li>Facebook also does not disclose ALL of the details of your OAT summary: “For technical and accuracy reasons, we don’t show all the activity we’ve received. This includes things like information we’ve received when you’re not logged into Facebook, or when we can’t confirm that you’ve previously used Facebook on that device. We also don’t show details like the item you’ve added to your shopping cart.” (Facebook)  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Geoffry Fowler in this Washington Post Article (link WaPo article) describes the situation as such: “Thanks to the “Off-Facebook Activity” tool, I now know that Home Depot told Facebook when I visited its online store, viewed an item or added an item to a shopping cart. The Atlantic shared the pages I viewed and devices I used, which it says inform its distribution strategy and help it target campaigns.” </p>
